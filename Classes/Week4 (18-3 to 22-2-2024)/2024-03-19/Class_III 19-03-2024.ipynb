Since it's not found there, it looks in `B`, then `C`, and finally in `A`.\n","- Python follows the MRO, which in this case is `D -> B -> C -> A`, so it finds `method` in `C` and invokes it.\n","\n","You can inspect the MRO of a class using the `__mro__` attribute or the `mro()` method:\n","\n","```python\n","print(D.__mro__)  # Output: (<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>)\n","print(D.mro())     # Output: [<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>]\n","```\n","\n","Understanding MRO is crucial for resolving method and attribute lookup order in complex inheritance hierarchies.
