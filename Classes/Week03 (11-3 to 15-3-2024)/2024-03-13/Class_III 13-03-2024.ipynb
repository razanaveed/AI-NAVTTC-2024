    "Association, aggregation, and composition are three types of relationships between classes in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Association**:\n",
    "   - Association represents a relationship between two classes where objects of one class are related to objects of another class.\n",
    "   - It is the simplest form of relationship, often represented by a line connecting two classes with an arrow indicating the direction of the relationship.\n",
    "   - In association, there is no ownership or lifecycle dependency between the objects.\n",
    "   - For example, a `Teacher` class may be associated with a `Student` class in a school system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Aggregation**:\n",
    "   - Aggregation is a specialized form of association where one class is a part of another class.\n",
    "   - It represents a \"has-a\" relationship where one class contains objects of another class.\n",
    "   - Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent.\n",
    "   - For example, a `Department` class may contain multiple `Employee` objects. If the department is deleted, employees can still exist.\n",
    "   - In UML diagrams, aggregation is represented by an empty diamond at the container end.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Composition**:\n",
    "   - Composition is a stronger form of aggregation where the lifetime of the contained object is dependent on the lifetime of the container object.\n",
    "   - It represents a \"owns-a\" relationship where the child cannot exist without the parent.\n",
    "   - When the parent object is destroyed, all its child objects are also destroyed.\n",
    "   - For example, a `Car` class may contain a `Engine` class. If the car is destroyed, the engine is also destroyed.\n",
    "   - In UML diagrams, composition is represented by a filled diamond at the container end.\n",
