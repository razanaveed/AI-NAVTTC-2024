    "In Python, classes and objects are fundamental concepts used for object-oriented programming (OOP). Here's a brief overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes:\n",
    "- A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.\n",
    "- Classes are defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name.\n",
    "- Class attributes are variables that are shared by all instances of the class, while instance attributes are unique to each instance.\n",
    "- Class methods are functions defined within the class and can operate on class or instance data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    # Class attribute\n",
    "    wheels = 4\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Constructor method to initialize instance attributes\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "        # Instance attributes\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Instance method\n",
    "    def info(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.make} {self.model} with {self.wheels} wheels\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects (instances) of the Car class\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
    "car2 = Car(\"Tesla\", \"Model S\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing object attributes and methods\n",
    "print(car1.info())  # Output: Toyota Corolla with 4 wheels\n",
    "print(car2.info())  # Output: Tesla Model S with 4 wheels\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects:\n",
    "- An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the class blueprint.\n",
    "- Each object has its own set of attributes and can perform actions defined by its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, `car1` and `car2` are objects of the `Car` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding classes and objects is crucial for building modular, maintainable, and reusable code in Python. They allow you to organize code into logical units and represent real-world entities in your programs."

    "Instance variables and methods are specific to individual instances (objects) of a class in Python. Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Variables:\n",
    "- Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class.\n",
    "- They are defined within the constructor method (`__init__`) using the `self` keyword.\n",
    "- These variables hold data that is specific to each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Instance variable\n",
    "        self.age = age    # Instance variable\n",

    "print(dog2.age)   # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Methods:\n",
    "- Instance methods are functions defined within a class that operate on instance variables.\n",
    "- They are defined similar to regular functions but take `self` as the first parameter, which refers to the instance calling the method.\n",
    "- Instance methods can access and modify instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} says Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating instances of the Dog class\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\n",
    "dog2 = Dog(\"Max\", 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling instance methods\n",
    "print(dog1.bark())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!\n",
    "print(dog2.bark())  # Output: Max says Woof!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, `bark()` is an instance method that accesses the instance variable `name` to form a string representation of the dog's bark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance variables and methods allow objects to maintain state and behavior unique to each instance, contributing to the flexibility and reusability of object-oriented programming in Python."

    "In Python, class variables and class methods are associated with the class itself rather than with instances of the class. Here's an explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Variables:\n",
    "- Class variables are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside of any methods.\n",
    "- Class variables are accessed using the class name itself or through an instance of the class.\n",
    "- They are typically used to store data that is common to all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "# Accessing class variable through an instance\n",
    "print(dog1.species)  # Output: Canine\n",
    "print(dog2.species)  # Output: Canine\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Methods:\n",
    "- Class methods are methods that are bound to the class rather than its instances. They are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator.\n",
    "- Class methods take the class itself (conventionally named `cls`) as their first parameter instead of the instance (`self`).\n",
    "- They can access and modify class variables, but they cannot access instance variables directly unless they are passed as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    species = \"Canine\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",

    "# Accessing class method\n",
    "Dog.change_species(\"Canis lupus\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing class variable after modification\n",
    "print(Dog.species)  # Output: Canis lupus\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Class variables and methods provide a way to define behavior and attributes that are shared across all instances of a class. They are useful for managing data that pertains to the class as a whole rather than to individual instances."

    "##### In Python, a decorator is a special type of function that wraps another function, allowing you to modify or extend its behavior without directly modifying the function itself. Decorators are commonly used for tasks such as logging, authentication, caching, and modifying function behavior at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators are denoted by the `@` symbol followed by the decorator function name, placed above the function definition. When you apply a decorator to a function, the decorator function is called with the original function as its argument. The decorator function can then perform some processing, such as adding functionality, modifying arguments, or intercepting the return value, before or after calling the original function.\n",
    "\n",

    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "say_hello()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `my_decorator` is a decorator function that takes another function (`func`) as its argument.\n",
    "- `wrapper` is a nested function within `my_decorator` that adds additional behavior before and after calling `func`.\n",
    "- `say_hello` is a function that is decorated with `@my_decorator`. When `say_hello` is called, it is actually `wrapper` that gets executed due to the decoration.\n",
    "- Inside `wrapper`, `say_hello` is called, and additional behavior is added before and after its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",

    "In Python, constructors and destructors are special methods used in classes for initialization and cleanup tasks, respectively.\n",

    "- In Python, the constructor method is named `__init__()`.\n",
    "- It is automatically called when an instance of a class is created.\n",

    "### Destructor:\n",
    "- In Python, the destructor method is named `__del__()`.\n",
    "- It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected.\n",
    "- The destructor is used to perform cleanup tasks such as releasing resources or closing connections.\n",

    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Object created\")\n",

    "        print(\"Object destroyed\")\n",

    "# Creating an instance of MyClass\n",
    "obj = MyClass()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Object is destroyed when it goes out of scope\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `__del__()` is called automatically when the `obj` instance goes out of scope and is about to be destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that in Python, the `__del__()` method is not guaranteed to be called at a specific time, and it's not recommended to rely on it for critical cleanup tasks. Instead, it's better to use context managers (`with` statement) or explicit cleanup methods for resource management."
